# Weather • or • Not

This application generates the current weather and 5-day forecast for a city of your choosing! The only input required is a city name, and the site will handle the rest. City searches will default to the most common US city match, but if you type a name not recognized within the US, it will search abroad! 


## Installation 

No installation is needed! You can visit the Weather • or • Not at https://sunnyohk.github.io/weather-or-not/


## Usage 

Finding a city's current weather conditions and 5-day outlook is easy! Just follow these quick steps:

- Visit: https://sunnyohk.github.io/weather-or-not/
- Type the city's name for which you'd like to view the weather
- Click 'Search'
- "Current Weather" and "5-Day Forecast" will populate automatically 
- If you would like to quickly navigate back to a city you've already searched, simply select it from the list that will populate as you search
- And to clear your list and start fresh, just click "Clear Past Searches"


## Resources and Shout-Outs

- Alex Gonzalez (EdX tutor) - Alex was able to walk me through the most important "WHY" of JavaScript, instead of just telling me "HOW" to make a function work. From our tutoring sessions, I was able to navigate my way through the creation of this application with full understanding of the code I was writing.


## Application Preview

<br>

### View Your Results
- At this point, the Current Weather table will populate with the name of your desired city, the current date, weather data (temperature, wind speed, humidity), and description box complete with the relevant icon:

#### <b>Important Notes:</b> 
1. City search results will return the most recognized 'city, st' within the US as a default. 
<br>(ex. 'Berlin' returns Berlin, NH)
2. If the city name does not exist within the US, the search results will then pull from the most recognized global location. 
<br>(ex. 'Tel Aviv' returns Tel Aviv in Israel)
3. Your most recent search will then be added to the <b>top</b> of your search history list. 
<br>(ex. 'Austin' was my first search, and 'Birmingham' was my most recent)

### Quickly Retrieve Weather for Previous Search
- Because your recent city searches have been saved, simply click on the city that you would like to revisit, and the weather + forecast information will automatically populate.
- If you happened to search this location a few days ago, no worries; the application will pull the most up-to-date weather report.
- And if that list is getting too long, just click 'Clear Past Searches' to start fresh.
