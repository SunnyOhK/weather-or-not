# Weather • or • Not

This application generates the current weather and 5-day forecast for a city of your choosing! The only input required is a city name, and the site will handle the rest. City searches will default to the most common US city match, but if you type a name not recognized within the US, it will search abroad! 


## Installation 

No installation is needed! You can visit the Weather • or • Not at https://sunnyohk.github.io/weather-or-not/


## Usage 

Finding a city's current weather conditions and 5-day outlook is easy! Just follow these quick steps:

- Visit: https://sunnyohk.github.io/weather-or-not/
- Type the city's name for which you'd like to view the weather
- Click 'Search'
- "Current Weather" and "5-Day Forecast" will populate automatically 
- If you would like to quickly navigate back to a city you've already searched, simply select it from the list that will populate as you search
- And to clear your list and start fresh, just click "Clear Past Searches"


## Resources and Shout-Outs
- Alex Gonzalez (EdX tutor) - Alex was able to walk me through the most important "WHY" of JavaScript, instead of just telling me "HOW" to make a function work. From our tutoring sessions, I was able to navigate my way through the creation of this application with full understanding of the code I was writing.
